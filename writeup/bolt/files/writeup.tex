Nmap scan shows three open ports which are:

\begin{wutable}[colored,texttt,caption=Nmap results]{l-l}{Port & Service}
    22 & SSH \\
    80 & HTTP \\
    443 & HTTPS \\

\section{Website port 80}
This site will let you download a docker image \enquote{image.tar} which you can load via \texttt{docker load -i image.tar}. Once imported you can launch that image with interactive shell.

You can find the source of a python flask app in this container.
If you run the app with flask and expose it to your attacker box you will be presented with a login page of \enquote{AdminLTE Flask}.

There are exploits for this software (also used by PiHole) but right now this looks like it cannot be used to do something

Login can be retrieved from the docker image and is \texttt{admin:deabolt}.

The comment section will tell us a few things about security concerns with the image and that there has to be a mail system somewhere.

\section{other vhosts}
Wfuzz will tell us there is also \enquote{mail} and \enquote{demo} as a vhost. Demo does not give us anything this moment and mail is a roundcube instance.
