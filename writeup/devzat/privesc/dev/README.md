Where are the devs at? Devzat!

Devzat is chat over SSH. Because there's SSH apps literally on all platforms, even your phone, you can connect to Devzat on any device!

## Usage

Try it out:

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443
```

If you add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host chat
    HostName devzat.hackclub.com
```

You'll be able to join with just:
```sh
ssh chat
```

We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!

### Help

```text
Welcome to Devzat! Devzat is chat over SSH: github.com/quackduck/devzat
Because there's SSH apps on all platforms, even on mobile, you can join from anywhere.

Interesting features:
â€¢ Many, many commands. Run /commands.
â€¢ Rooms! Run /room to see all rooms and use /room #foo to join a new room.
â€¢ Markdown support! Tables, headers, italics and everything. Just use \n in place of newlines.
â€¢ Code syntax highlighting. Use Markdown fences to send code. Run /example-code to see an example.
â€¢ Direct messages! Send a quick DM using =user <msg> or stay in DMs by running /room @user.
â€¢ Timezone support, use /tz Continent/City to set your timezone.
â€¢ Built in Tic Tac Toe and Hangman! Run /tic or /hang <word> to start new games.
â€¢ Emoji replacements! :rocket: => ðŸš€  (like on Slack and Discord)

For replacing newlines, I often use bulkseotools.com/add-remove-line-breaks.php.
